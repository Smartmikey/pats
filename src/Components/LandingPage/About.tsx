              We understand the significance of providing the animal industry
              with a safe and responsible platform. Thus, PATS, was created. An
              easy-to-use platform that brings the animal industry into the
              cloud, while ensuring all our users are secure. With this
              marketplace, users can browse and buy with confidence knowing they
              will be interacting with businesses that share a commitment to
              safety and responsible practices.

              After three years of working hand in hand with animal breeders and
              organizations, it became apparent that the animal industry lacked
              direction and supervision. Leaving business owners and
              organizations, that want to make a difference in the lives of
              animals with few resources to work with.{" "}

            <Typography>
              The lack of centralized online directories or marketplaces meant
              that many such initiatives did not have the ability to advertise
              for themselves, let alone reach their target audience or make any
              meaningful progress. In December of 2022, the PATS team began
              building the animal industryâ€™s first comprehensive marketplace.
              Which values efficiency and transparency. We are very excited with
              everyone who has joined our waitlist, as we prepare for our launch
              in late Q1 of 2023!
